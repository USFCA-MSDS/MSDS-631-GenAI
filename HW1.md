# Homework Assignment: Beta-VAE on the CelebA Dataset

## Overview

In this assignment, you will train a Beta-VAE (BVAE) on the CelebA dataset using the codebase provided in the [PyTorch-VAE repository](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE). You will set up the environment, prepare the dataset, modify the necessary configurations, run the training process, and analyze the results. Your work will be documented and submitted in a single Jupyter notebook.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python and PyTorch.
- Understanding of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Beta-VAEs.
- Familiarity with Jupyter notebooks and working in a command-line environment.

## Repository

The code you will use is located in the [PyTorch-VAE repository](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE). Specifically, you will work with the Beta-VAE implementation in `models/beta_vae.py`.

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE.git
cd PyTorch-VAE
```

### 2. Prepare the CelebA Dataset

Download the CelebA dataset from the [official website](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). Extract the dataset and place it in a directory, noting the path.


### 3. Create a Jupyter Notebook

Create a new Jupyter notebook in the root directory of the cloned repository. 



### 4. Document Your Workflow

In your Jupyter notebook, document your entire workflow:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly explain the goal of the assignment and the concept of Beta-VAE.
2. **Data Preparation**: Show how you downloaded and prepared the CelebA dataset.
3. **Training**: Include the code to train the Beta-VAE model. Use the `main.py` script provided in the repository.
4. **Results Analysis**: Visualize the reconstructed images, latent space traversals, and loss curves. Discuss your findings.
5. **Experimentation**: Experiment with different beta values and analyze their impact on the results.


After training completes, analyze the results:

- Visualize the reconstructed images and latent space representations.
- Evaluate the model performance using reconstruction loss and KLD loss.
- Experiment with different values of beta to observe its effect on the disentanglement of learned features.

### 5. Conclusion

Summarize your findings and insights gained from the experiment. Include any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

### 6. Submission

Submit the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) that contains all the above sections.

## Notes

- Ensure you follow best practices for coding and experimentation.
- Your notebook should be well-documented and easy to follow.
- Include visualizations and analyses that clearly demonstrate your understanding of Beta-VAE and the CelebA dataset.
