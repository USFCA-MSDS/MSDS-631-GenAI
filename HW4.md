In this homework you will read the AutoEncoder given here :
https://github.com/1zb/3DShape2VecSet/blob/bedbd1091664be8e2409d580c4e1630df1a37c89/models_ae.py#L182

and review the paper assocated with this repo : https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11445 along with our lecture https://github.com/USFCA-MSDS/MSDS-631-GenAI/blob/main/mesh_generation.pdf

(1) Why do you think the authors have input a point cloud and output occupancy field ? can you explain the reason in simple words?

(2) Explain the code lines 229 to 283 in here: https://github.com/1zb/3DShape2VecSet/blob/bedbd1091664be8e2409d580c4e1630df1a37c89/models_ae.py#L229
Explain in particular the lines where we use the cross attention layer.

(3) After reading the paper, how do you think the code above can be improve ? explain your intuition and reasons.
